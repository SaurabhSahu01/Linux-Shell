This is an Operating System Assignment given by Asst. Prof. Mukesh Giluka.

To run the shell : 1.) Place all the files in the same directory
                   2.) Locate that directory using the terminal
                   3.) Run the command - "make"

You can run all the major commands using this shell. However the I/O Redirection WILL NOT work in this shell for now.

Upcoming Updates : I/O redirections will be added
